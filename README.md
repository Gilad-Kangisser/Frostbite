• Initially, a Splash Screen with game instructions has been implemented,
where the user needs to press Enter to start the game.

•The game character, Bailey, is able to move horizontally whilst on ice block.
•Bailey is able to move vertically, jumping from each ice block level towards the safe zone. 
•Bailey cannot exceed the boundaries of the game window.
•If Bailey comes in contact with the 'water' he dies, and returns to initial position. 

•Test cases were implemented to check the functionality of the game window, player positioning, 
player movement, ice block movement (including wrapping functionality) and game boundaries.
